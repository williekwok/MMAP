    <em>About MMAP</em>
</p>
<p>
    The Marine Mammal Authorization Program (MMAP) allows commercial fishers to lawfully "incidentally take" a marine mammal in a commercial fishery.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Authorization </em>
</p>
<p>
    If you own a commercial vessel or non-vessel gear engaging in a <strong>Category I or II fishery</strong>, you must obtain a marine mammal authorization
    certificate from NOAA Fisheries, or our designated agent, in order to lawfully incidentally take a marine mammal in a commercial fishery.
</p>
<p>
    <em>How do I report a mortality/injury of a marine mammal incurred during the course of commercial fishing operations?</em>
</p>
<p>
    You <strong>must,</strong> regardless of your category, report every incidental mortality and injury of marine mammals that occurs as a result of
    commercial fishing operations. If you do not report within 48 hours, you may be subject to suspension, revocation, or denial of a marine mammal
    authorization certificate
</p>
<p>
    This reporting form is required <strong>only when</strong> there is an incidental or intentional mortality or injury to a marine mammal during commercial
    fishing activities. You are required to report the mortality or injury within 48 hours after the end of the fishing trip (even if an observer is on board),
    or, for non-vessel fisheries, within 48 hours of an occurrence of a mortality or injury. A separate report form is required for each fishery, for each
    date, and for each location.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Can I deter marine mammals from fishing gear and catch?</em>
</p>
<p>
    While you are strictly <strong>prohibited</strong> from intentionally lethally taking marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations,
    intentional lethal take is authorized <strong>if</strong> imminently necessary in self-defense or to save the life of another person. If a marine mammal is
    killed in self-defense or to save the life of another person, you must file a report with NOAA Fisheries within <strong>48 hours</strong> of the end of the
    fishing trip or, for non-vessel fisheries, within 48 hours of the mortality. The report can be made using the mortality/injury reporting forms and
    procedures described above.
